    - Complex queries requiring multiple steps of research

    - Regenerate the entire task list with updated statuses
    - Mark completed tasks as 'completed'
    - Mark the next task to work on as 'in_progress'

    WHEN TO USE:
    1. PROGRESS REVIEW - After completing a meaningful step
       "Kipchoge's record found: 2:01:09. Moving to moon distance research."

    2. ERROR ANALYSIS - When a tool fails or returns unexpected results
       "Wikipedia tool failed. Cause: service unavailable. Alternative: use web search."

    3. RESULT SYNTHESIS - When combining information from multiple sources
       "Two different moon distances found. Problem asks for closest approach, so using perigee: 356,500km."

    4. SELF CHECK - Before providing final answer
       "Have all required data: marathon pace 20.81km/h, moon distance 356,500km. Ready to calculate."

    WHEN NOT TO USE:
    - After every single tool call (excessive overhead)
    - During simple, straightforward operations
    - When everything is proceeding as expected

        analysis: Your assessment of current situation and next direction
